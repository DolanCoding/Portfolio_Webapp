## 2025-08-11
- Tracked `package-lock.json` files and updated `.gitignore` rules in root and backend package to allow `npm ci`.
- Regenerated lockfiles for frontend and backend.
- Backend: `npm ci`, tests, typecheck, and lint all pass.
- Frontend: `npm ci` succeeds, typecheck passes, but `test:ci` fails with a `RangeError` and lint fails due to a warning.
- Next steps: fix frontend lint warning and investigate vitest `RangeError`.
